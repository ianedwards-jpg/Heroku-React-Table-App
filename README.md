# Heroku-React-Table-App
 
## Overview

Heroku JSON Table Application is a dynamic table used to display JSON data in a table that can be sorted alphabetically, by phone number, by Employee ID or any other field.

## Views


Heroku JSON Table Application is a single page table that will allow you to view and sort JSON data in ascending or decending order per each field.

![Main Page](https://github.com/ianedwards-jpg/Heroku-React-Table-App/blob/master/react-table-heroku/client/public/react_table.jpg)

Users can sort the table by

* User ID 

* Job Title

* First Name 

* Last Name 

* Preferred Name 

* Employee Code 

* Employee Region 

* Phone Number 

* Email 

## Usage 

If you wish to view your own JSON via this application, you will need to update the URL within the Ajax call, as well as the "req" fields to match the data you are trying to map. You will also have manually modify the column titles to fit your JSON. 

## Future Development

In the future, I wish to modify the GUI so that a URL can be inserted and JSON added to the table via an on-screen URL bar.
